# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray

This project is a web-based application built using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow** that detects whether a chest X-ray image shows signs of **Pneumonia** or is **Normal**.

## 🚀 Demo

Upload a chest X-ray image, and the app will analyze it using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict:
- **NORMAL**
- **PNEUMONIA**

## 🧠 Model

- Trained on a dataset of labeled chest X-ray images 
- CNN architecture (e.g., based on VGG16, MobileNet, or a custom model).
- Model saved as `best_model.h5`.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow 
- Streamlit 📊
- PIL / NumPy

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📸 Sample Images

You can test the app using sample chest X-ray images of:
- Normal lungs
- Pneumonia-infected lungs

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
